# MusicPal Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
Our program provides a straightforward login and signup process that is equally accessible to all users. The user interface uses standard form inputs and buttons that are compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies. 
Our application could benefit from more explicit color contrast and text size options to improve usability for users with visual impairments.

### 2. Flexibility in Use
Our program offers some flexibility through its preference setting system, allowing users to customize their music recommendations. 
Users can input their preferred songs, genres, artists, and albums, providing a degree of personalization. 
Future improvements could include more granular preference settings to accommodate different user needs. For instance, generating a playlist depending on the user's mood.

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
Our program uses a card-based layout with clear navigation between different screens (login, signup, main menu, preferences). Buttons are labeled plainly, and the flow between screens is logical and predictable. The interface relies on standard GUI elements that most users would find familiar, reducing the learning curve.

### 4. Perceptible Information
Our program uses text-based information and simple dialog boxes to communicate with users. 
However, it lacks advanced features for users with sensory limitations, such as text-to-speech capabilities or high-contrast modes. 
There's room for improvement in making information presentation more accessible to users with different perceptual abilities.

### 5. Tolerance for Error
Our program includes error handling in user registration and login processes, providing clear error messages when inputs are invalid or authentication fails. 

### 6. Low Physical Effort
The interface of our program is designed with standard GUI components that minimize complex gestures or movements. The preference setting and recommendation processes are straightforward and do not demand extensive physical effort.

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program uses gridded layouts that provide clear spacing between elements. Future versions could implement responsive design principles to improve adaptability.

## Target Market

MusicPal would be primarily marketed towards music enthusiasts who are looking for personalized music recommendations but find existing streaming platforms' recommendation algorithms too generic or limited. The ideal user is someone who enjoys discovering new music across various genres, values a curated listening experience, and is willing to actively participate in refining their musical preferences. This could include young adults and professionals aged 18-35 who are tech-savvy, have diverse musical tastes, and are interested in using AI-driven technology to enhance their music discovery process.

## Potential Demographic Limitations

MusicPal might be less accessible or appealing to certain demographics. Older users who are less comfortable with technology might find the AI-driven recommendation system and GUI intimidating. Users with limited internet access or technological resources may be excluded, as the application relies on external services like OpenAI. Additionally, the current design might not fully accommodate users with significant visual, auditory, or motor impairments, potentially creating barriers for individuals who rely heavily on assistive technologies.
